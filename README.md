# AlphaVantage_js v0.1
A lightweight Angular implementation of the Alpha Vantage securities API

Uses Angular 1.6.4, W3 and FontAwesome via CDN.

Currently handles all search options provided by the Alpha Vantage API

All data regarding API options is set in js/data.js.
This includes API key, and all available search functions and parameters.
The API key is by default set to 'demo'.  The 'demo' key is valid so it still retains most of the search functionality.

Todo:
Better description in search results
Presentable parameter names
Descriptions for parameters and search functions
Does not support extendiod period searches, I'll probably add a checkbox for this
